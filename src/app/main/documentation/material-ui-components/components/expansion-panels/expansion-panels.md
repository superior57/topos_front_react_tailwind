# Expansion Panels

<p class="description">Expansion panels contain creation flows and allow lightweight editing of an element.</p>

[An expansion panel](https://material.io/archive/guidelines/components/expansion-panels.html) is a lightweight container that may either stand alone or be connected to a larger surface, such as a card.

> **Note:** Expansion panels are no longer documented in the Material Design documentation.

## Accessibility

For optimal accessibility we recommend setting `id` and `aria-controls` on the
`ExpansionPanelSummary`. The `ExpansionPanel` will derive the necessary `aria-labelledby`
and `id` for the content region of the panel.

## Simple Expansion Panel

## Controlled Accordion

Extend the default panel behavior to create an accordion with the `ExpansionPanel` component.

## Secondary heading and Columns

Multiple columns can be used to structure the content, and a helper text may be added to the panel to assist the user.

## Performance

The content of ExpansionPanels is mounted by default even if the panel is not expanded.
This default behavior has server-side rendering and SEO in mind.
If you render expensive component trees inside your panels or simply render many
panels it might be a good idea to change this default behavior by enabling the
`unmountOnExit` in `TransitionProps`: `<ExpansionPanel TransitionProps={{ unmountOnExit: true }} />`.
As with any performance optimization this is not a silver bullet. Be sure to identify
bottlenecks first and then try out these optimization strategies.

## Customized expansion panels

Here is an example of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the
[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).
